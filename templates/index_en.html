	       <h3>Oil & Gas Growth Strategy Study</h3>
    		<p>This client is a large (7,000+ people) company with a strong business in the Asia-Pacific region including oil & gas clients. They were looking to grow a presence in oil and gas in the UK and Europe as part of a general strategy to expand its energy – specifically upstream oil and gas - business worldwide with three clear aims: <strong>grow company size, increase geographical offering to existing clients, increase exposure to oil & gas and energy sector as part of company diversification.</strong></p>
            <p>The client wanted to explore the possibilities for acquisition led and organic growth with companies which can fully embrace the client’s culture, which will add capability, will have synergy with SKM’s existing businesses, will be meaningful to clients and will be significant in driving SKM’s growth
            A single acquisition was unlikely to be sufficient;  there are not enough large companies with the right attributes to be able to find a good match and acquisition of a single small company will not create the right conditions for appropriately rapid organic growth.  Hence a combination of purchases and selective recruitment of staff was to be considered.</p>
            <p>We prepared a strategic review of acquisition targets in the upstream energy sector in United Kingdom and Europe, concentrating on front-end consultancies but also considering larger, vertically integrated companies who complemented the clients existing skillset.  We used our extensive knowledge of the sector as well as focused searches of industry databases to deliver the report to the client’s satisfaction and in a very rapid timescale.  The  study has led to further work for the same client, including selective interviews and due-diligence with selected targets.</p>
         </div>

            <h3>Oil & Gas Decommissioning Strategy</h3>
            <p>The client is a large engineering and programme management company with extensive experience in the nuclear remediation industry (amongst other businesses), employing over 57,000 people worldwide and annual revenues of nearly $10 billion.</p>
            <p>They were considering an entry into the highly regulated UK and Norwegian offshore oil & gas decommissioning market and were looking to gain an insight into the available market opportunities, the capabilities required to address such work, the partnerships or acquisitions which would be necessary to deliver a complete market offer.</p>
            <p>Westlord Associates delivered a market assessment looking at both the long-term and near-term market, looking closely at the market segments involved and the range of technologier required.  </p>
            <p>Using our industry knowledge gained through the leadership roles taken in industry associations such as Decom North Sea and in organising major regional conferences, we focused on 3 specific projects and on the particular combination of technical and commercial considerations which would be required to deliver value both to customers and to the client.</p>
            <p>Following this successful study, a similar study was carried out for a UK based company approaching the same market but with a different skill-set and different commercial objectives.</p>

            <span class="count">3/4</span>
             <h3>Major Project Peer Review – Offshore Decommissioning</h3>
             <p>The client is a large UK based energy operator with interests throughout Europe.  Following acquisition of a large share in a Norwegian asset, the client was asked to participate in a “Cold Eyes” review of a major project - valued at over £200 million - which was being planned by the asset’s majority shareholder and operator. </p>
              <p>The client required specific knowledge of the Norwegian business environment and regulations, together with extensive experience of major project management, planning and cost estimating and detailed technical knowledge of the project scope.  This combination of skills was not within the client’s organisation so Westlord Associates was asked to lead part of the review, involving review of project documentation, interviews with project personnel, facilitated meetings with other technical experts and structured feedback to the operator.</p>
<p>The assignment was carried out partly in our own office and partly at the operator’s office in Norway and Westlord Associates continues to provide advice to our client on this project as it develops into the next phase.</p>

            <h3>Financial Assessment and Cost Estimates for Decommissioning Liabilities</h3>
            <p>Through our involvement and Board membership of the industry trade association, <a href="http://www.decomnorthsea.com">Decom North Sea</a>, Westlord Associates has taken a leading position in helping companies to understand the market for decommissioning of offshore oil & gas facilities throughout the North Sea.  This understanding is necessary for both operating companies and also contractors who will be engaged to carry out the physical work of platform and facility removal.</p>
<p>Westlord Associates has carried out a review of the forecasted UK decommissioning market for Decom North Sea and has also provided independent commentary on the Oil & Gas UK Decommissioning Insights (which forecast the overall value and timing of the UK offshore decommissioning market to 2050) and to the UK Treasury consultation on decommissioning tax relief. </p>
<p>Our managing director, Alex West, has led teams in decommissioning consultancy and execution for over 8 years and is now able to offer an independent service, ranging from advice on decommissioning provisions, estimates and project forecasts to independent and impartial review of the estimating process to assessment of decommissioning costs and the role of technical expert in an arbitration and cost-redetermination process (for example as part of the Decommissioning Cost Provision Deed review).<p>
<p>Alex West has taken a leading role in championing a policy of involvement with lawyers, accountants, insurer, finance advisers and other professional service providers in order to provide a holistic consulting service and has given presentations to international conferences, specialist seminars and in-house training sessions.  Westlord Associates is committed to enhancing the understanding of the relationship between cost forecasts and actual project costs so that operators and contractors alike can predict future expenditure and investment with as much precision as possible and ultimately to increase the value which can be obtained from oil & gas assets.</p>
